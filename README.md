## Command-line guide

Marteau contains several subcommands:

- `dialogue <markdown-path> <output-timeline-path>`: Convert a Markdown file into a compatible
  timeline. This does _not_ account for background image changes, sound changes, or signal
  emissions. This tool is designed to create a quick-start timeline where details can be added
  later.
    - Optional: `--characters <charpath>`: A path to a list of JSON files that contain character
      definitions in Dialogic format.
    - Optional: `--debug`: Enables debug messaging. If the output format is `'jenson'`, a
      debugging JSON file is created.
    - Optional: `--format <dialogic|jenson>`: The output format to convert the dialogue to.
      Default is `'dialogic'`.
- `portraits <portraits-path>`: Import portrait definitions into Dialogic by reading from the
  portraits directory.
